# Egyptian History RAG System with Gemini 2.0 Flash

A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system for querying large Egyptian history PDF documents, powered by Gemini 2.0 for language generation and Sentence Transformers for embeddings.

## Key Features

- **Gemini 2.0 Integration**: Uses Google's latest Gemini 2.0 Flash model for high-quality responses
- **Flask API**: Model services hosted locally for efficient reuse
- **Large PDF Handling**: Optimized for 1000+ page documents
- **Source Citation**: Provides references back to original document pages
- **Persistent Indexing**: Vector store maintains indexed documents between sessions
- **User Authentication**: Secure JWT-based authentication with email verification
- **Chat History Management**: Persistent conversation tracking with MongoDB

## System Architecture

```
    A[User Query] --> B[Flask API]
    B --> C[Retriever]
    C --> D[Vector Store]
    B --> E[Gemini 2.0 LLM]
    D --> E
    E --> F[Response with Sources]
```
The diagram shows:

1. **Flow Sequence**:
   - User submits query to Flask API
   - API routes request to Retriever
   - Retriever searches Vector Store
   - Results are passed to Gemini LLM
   - LLM combines context and knowledge
   - Final response with sources is returned

2. **Key Components**:
   - `Flask API`: Main request handler
   - `Retriever`: Semantic search component
   - `Vector Store`: Stored document embeddings
   - `Gemini 2.0 Flash LLM`: Response generator
   - `Response with Sources`: Final output with citations

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Node.js 16+
- Google Cloud account (for Gemini API)
- GPU recommended (not required)
- MongoDB 6.0+ (local installation or Atlas cloud)
- MongoDB Compass (GUI recommended)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/OmarOssama25/RAG_Backend_EgyptianHistory.git
    cd RAG_Backend_EgyptianHistory
    ```

2. **Install Python dependencies**

    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Install Node.js dependencies**

    ```
    npm install
    ```

4. **Install MongoDB**
    - **Windows:** Download and install from [MongoDB Community Download](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community)
    - **Mac (Homebrew):**
        ```
        brew tap mongodb/brew
        brew install mongodb-community
        ```
    - **Ubuntu/Linux:**
        ```
        sudo apt-get install mongodb
        ```

5. **Start MongoDB**

    - **Windows:**  
      Open Command Prompt as Administrator and run:
      ```
      net start MongoDB
      ```
    - **Mac (Homebrew):**

6. **Connect to MongoDB (optional, for testing)**

    ```
    mongosh "mongodb://localhost:27017/egyptian_history_rag"
    ```

7. **Set up environment variables**

    Create a `.env` file in the `backend/` directory (or root, if your setup expects it there):

    ```
    GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
    FLASK_PORT=5050
    NODE_PORT=5000
    MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/egyptian_history_rag

    EMAIL_USER=your_email@example.com
    EMAIL_PASSWORD=your_email_password
    EMAIL_FROM=no-reply@egyptianhistory.com
    ```

8. **Verify MongoDB Connection**

    - You can use [MongoDB Compass](https://www.mongodb.com/products/compass) for a GUI.
    - Or test in the shell:
      ```
      mongosh "mongodb://localhost:27017/egyptian_history_rag"
      show dbs
      ```

## Running the System

### Start the Flask Model Services (Port 5050)

1. **First Terminal**:
```
python model_server.py
```
This will start:
- Gemini 2.0 LLM service at `http://localhost:5050/llm`
- Embedding service at `http://localhost:5050/embed`

### Start the Node.js Server (Port 5000)

2. **Second Terminal**:
```
npm start
```

The main API will be available at `http://localhost:5000`

#### Conversation History Examples

**First Query:**
```json
{
  "query": "Who built the Great Pyramid of Giza?",
  "conversationId": "682c95e92808a47dc799310c"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "answer": "Okay, I can certainly tell you who built the Great Pyramid of Giza!\n\nBased on the documents you've provided, the Great Pyramid of Giza was built for **King Khufu (also referred to as Khofo)**, a pharaoh of the 4th Dynasty (c. 2589–2566 BC) (Document 1, Page 41; Document 4, Pages 366). It was intended to be his royal tomb (Document 4, Page 366). The construction of the Great Pyramid is considered one of the greatest engineering achievements in history and took approximately 20 years to complete (Document 4, Page 366).\n\nIt's interesting to note that the Giza pyramid complex, also called the Giza Necropolis, includes the Great Pyramid, the Pyramid of Khafre, and the Pyramid of Menkaure, along with the Great Sphinx (Document 2, Page 142). Khafre was Khufu's son, and Menkaure was his grandson (Document 1, Page 41). All these structures were built during the Fourth Dynasty of the Old Kingdom of ancient Egypt, between approximately 2600 and 2500 BC (Document 2, Page 142).\n\nAlso, just to clarify, while there's mention of a \"Pharaoh's pyramid\" being the largest in Giza (Document 5, Page 366), this seems to be a general reference to Khufu's Great Pyramid, which is indeed the largest.\n",

```json
{
  "query": "When did he rule Egypt?",
  "conversationId": "682c95e92808a47dc799310c"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "answer": "Okay, I can definitely tell you when King Khufu, the pharaoh who built the Great Pyramid of Giza, ruled Egypt!\n\nBased on the documents, King Khufu (also referred to as Khofo) ruled Egypt approximately from **2589–2566 BC** (Document 1, Page 41). He was a pharaoh of the 4th Dynasty (Document 1, Page 41). It's worth noting that the Giza pyramid complex, including the pyramids of Khafre (Khufu's son) and Menkaure (Khufu's grandson), were all built during the Fourth Dynasty of the Old Kingdom, between approximately 2600 and 2500 BC (Document 2, Page 142).\n",

**Second Follow-up Query:**
```json
{
  "query": "How tall was it when initially built?",
  "conversationId": "682c95e92808a47dc799310c"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "answer": "Okay, I can certainly help you with information about the height of the Great Pyramid of Giza!\n\nUnfortunately, none of the provided documents in the current context explicitly state the exact initial height of the Great Pyramid of Giza. While Document 3 mentions the height of a \"particle pyramid\" as being about 136.4 meters, it also clarifies that this is the *second* largest pyramid in Giza, after the \"Khvo pyramid\" (which I believe is a typo and meant to refer to Khufu's pyramid). So, this doesn't give us the specific height we're looking for.\n\nHowever, based on our previous conversation, we know that the Great Pyramid of Giza was built for King Khufu (c. 2589–2566 BC) during the 4th Dynasty (Document 1, Page 41). It is also considered the oldest and largest of the three pyramids at Giza (Document 1, Page 41).\n\nWhile I can't give you the exact height based on these documents, it's safe to say it was taller than 136.4 meters, which is the height of the second largest pyramid mentioned in Document 3. To get the precise original height, we'd need a document that explicitly states that measurement.\n",

## Configuration Options

Modify `config.json` to adjust system behavior:
```
{
  "chunk_size": 500,
  "chunk_overlap": 100,
  "top_k": 5,
  "temperature": 0.7,
  "embedding_batch_size": 32,
  "max_tokens": 1024,
  "jwt_expiration": "7d",
  "verification_expiry": "24h"
}
```

## Troubleshooting

**Common Issues**:

1. **Gemini API Errors**:
   - Verify your Google Cloud API key has Gemini enabled
   - Check quota limits in Google Cloud Console

2. **Indexing Fails on Large PDFs**:
   - Reduce `chunk_size` in config.json
   - Increase `embedding_batch_size`

3. **Port Conflicts**:
   - Change ports in `.env` file if 5050/5000 are occupied

4. **CUDA Out of Memory**:
   - Restart the Flask service to clear memory
   - Reduce batch sizes in config

5. **Authentication Issues**:
   - Check that JWT_SECRET is properly set in .env
   - Verify email verification process is working
   - Ensure token is being passed correctly in Authorization header
